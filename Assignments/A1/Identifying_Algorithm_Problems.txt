Problems with the algorithm
1) How to combine the ingredients
 - It does not specify how to combine the ingredients, is it done in a bowl before putting it on a hot pan?
2) The bread
 - It does not specify the type of bread to be used or the slice portions that need to be cut.
3) The amount of butter
 - Small is very subjective. Does the butter get spread all over the pan or left in a clump?
4) Serving the French toast with a sweet dip
 - How much would be added to the French toast? How would one determine which sweet syrup or jam to use?
5) Dipping the bread in mixture
 - It does not specify how long the bread should be dipped for; in and out instantly or letting it soak some of the batter?
